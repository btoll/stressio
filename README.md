# stressio

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com/btoll/stressio.git
$ cd stressio
$ pip3 install --editable .
```

This will install a "binary" to `$HOME/.local/bin/stressio`.

If `stressio` cannot be found as a command-line tool, make sure that `$HOME/.local/bin` is in your `PATH`.

> Want to know more about how the binary is installed?  Of course you do!  The Python tooling is called `console_scripts`, and you can find a brief introduction and example on [the world's most dangerous website].
